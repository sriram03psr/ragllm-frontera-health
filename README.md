Utilization of Modules and Techniques for Text Processing and Question Answering

# PDF Cleaning with fitz Module:

Utilized the fitz module to clean a normal PDF document.
fitz is a Python library for interacting with PDF files, allowing for text extraction and manipulation.
# Embedding with Hugging Face Model:

Employed a Hugging Face model for text embedding.
Hugging Face provides a wide range of pre-trained language models, including the meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf model, for various natural language processing tasks.
# Storage in Faize Vector Database:

Stored the embeddings generated from the PDF content in a Faize vector database.
Faize vector database offers efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional vectors, facilitating quick access to embeddings for further analysis.
# Creation of QA Model with Hugging Face LLM:

Developed a question answering (QA) model using the Hugging Face meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf model.
This model is specifically trained for conversational tasks and question answering, making it suitable for extracting relevant information from text.
# Implementation Summary:

The process involved extracting text from a PDF document using fitz, generating embeddings using Hugging Face models, storing these embeddings in a Faize vector database, and finally creating a QA model with the Hugging Face LLM for answering questions based on the embedded text.
# Conclusion:

The integration of these modules and techniques allowed for effective processing and analysis of text data, enabling tasks such as information retrieval and question answering with high efficiency and accuracy.
